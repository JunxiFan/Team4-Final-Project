# Team 4 : Smart Music Composer

## synopsis
 * In our project, we are going to input audio file in 
format of MIDI and this time we focus on several styles
 of music(Pop, Jazz, Classical music, etc.). After 
 processed by our functions, our project would generate 
 a set number of new songs with different styles.
 * A user can input multiple songs into this system, and get a machine-generated song.
